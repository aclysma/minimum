# minimum

A collection of utilites for games. The goal is to provide a relatively thin framework that helps knit together 3rd party libraries and your game logic.

# Examples

There is a collection of small samples in [/minimum-examples](minimum-examples).

Additionally, [/minimum-demo](minimum-demo) shows a more realistic integration of 
these utilities with other popular libraries like `winit`, `gfx-hal`, `rendy`, `nphysics`, and `imgui`.
